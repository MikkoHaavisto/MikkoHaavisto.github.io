Bootstrap is developed mobile first, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your <head>.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

Box-sizing
For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global box-sizing value from content-box to border-box. This ensures padding does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.

JavaScript tags in the bottom of the file.
jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS


Reboot
For improved cross-browser rendering, we use Reboot to correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.


Overriding
Add own CSS links below the bootstrap link.
